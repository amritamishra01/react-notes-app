# React Notes App
# Introduction
A web application with **CRUD** (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) functionality built using **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that allows the user to view, create, update and delete notes in the form of visual cards.
# Tech stacks used
 - **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** - For database functionality
 - **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)** - For handling server side (backend) functions
 - **[React](https://react.dev/)** - For frontend and client side functions
 - **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)** - For backend functions
# Approach
## Backend
### General
 - Express routers are used to handle user and note functions.
 - [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is used to handle MongoDB connection.

### Authentication
 - HTTP **POST** requests are used for both sign up and log in.
 - Signing up requires creating a username, entering email and password.
 - Uses [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to encrypt passwords given by users before storing them in database.
 - Before sign up, the API checks DB to ensure email does not already exist.
 - For logging in, DB is checked to make sure user exists. 
 - Then a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) token is created after signing the payload (the user ID in the database) with a secret key and given an expiration time of 1 day.
 - After successful login, this token is returned.
 - For every operation involving notes, this token is sent in the appropriate HTTP request's header.
 - If token expires, user is requested to login again.
### Database Models/Schema
 - Two models - user and note
 - User model contains username, email, and password (encrypted), also auto-generated user ID.
 - Note model contains title, body and user ID of the user who created it, also auto-generated note ID.
### Creating Notes
 - An HTTP **POST** request is sent with the aforementioned **token** in its header.
 - Notes are in JSON form containing title and body.
 - The user for which note is created is identified from token.
 - Uses `save` method from Mongoose.
### Retrieving Notes
 - An HTTP **GET** request is sent with the token in its header.
 - The user ID is identified from token and the DB is searched for notes having user ID of current user.
 - Uses `find` method from Mongoose.
 - The notes are then sent back in JSON form.
### Updating Notes
 - An HTTP **PATCH** request is sent to the API whose header contains the token as well as the ID of the required note.
 - The new title and body is sent in JSON form.
 - It uses `findByIdAndUpdate` method from Mongoose.
### Deleting Notes
 - An HTTP **DELETE** request is sent to the API with the token and required note ID in its header.
 - It uses `findByIdAndDelete` method from Mongoose.

All methods send appropriate status messages (successful/unsuccessful) upon completion.

## Frontend
### Components
 - The look and feel of the frontend as well as several components like navigation bar, note cards, buttons, dialog boxes and avatars have been derived from [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
 - It has 4 pages: Home, Login, Sign up and Notes.
 - Components used - Navigation bar, Note card, Modal, Avatar, Menu, Button.
#### Home page
 Contains links to log in and sign up
#### Sign up page
 - User has to fill up the required fields and click on Sign Up button
 - `useState()` function is used to set default values for username, email, password.
 - The input given by user is then passed on to the API by Axios.
 - After successful sign up, user is taken to login page.
#### Login page
 - User has to fill up the required fields and click on Log In button
 - `useState()` function is used to set default values for email and password.
 - The input given by user is then passed on to the API by Axios.
 - After successful login, user is taken to notes page.
#### Notes page
 - Notes are displayed in the form of visual cards.
 - `useEffect()` function is used to get notes and display them.
 - On clicking '+' button user can create notes.
 - `useDisclosure()` function is used to open a dialog box/Modal where user can enter title and body of note.
 - On clicking 'Create' button, create notes function is dispatched from Note redux.
 - Or user can click 'Close' button to cancel operation.
#### Note Card
 - Contains title and body of note
 - Contains two buttons: Update and Delete.
 - On clicking 'Update' button a dialog box is opened where user can enter the new title and body of note.
 - On clicking 'Update' button update notes function is dispatched.
 - On clicking 'Delete' button delete notes function is dispatched from Note redux.
#### Navigation Bar
 - It uses `useSelector()` function to find out the current state of the application.
 - When not logged in, it contains buttons for Log In and Sign Up.
 - On Log In, it displays an avatar for the user and a button 'All Notes'.
 - On clicking the avatar a dropdown menu is displayed containing the username and Logout button.
 - Clicking 'Logout' button will dispatch the logout state from User redux.
### Routing
 - The Notes page (and in turn all notes functionality) is routed through a private route that first checks whether user is logged in or not.
 - It does so by using `useSelector()` function that takes as a parameter the selector function which takes in the current state of the program from the Redux store.
### Redux
 - Two types: User redux and Note redux
 - User redux contains various states such as initial state, login loading state, login successful state, login error state and logout state (leading back to initial state).
 - On successful login, the user ID and the token generated are returned.
 - The login is handled by [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) which makes the proper HTTP request and returns the response.
 - Note redux contains 3 types of states - get notes, update notes and delete notes, each of which are then divided into 3 states - loading, success and error.
 - All note actions are also handled by Axios and HTTP requests are made according to the format given in backend.
 - The `useDispatch()` function is used to transmit the Redux states for operating the frontend.
 - Both user and note reducers are combined and stored with `redux-thunk` middleware applied.
 - It allows us to handle asynchronous actions and side effects by dispatching actions from within the thunk.
## Deployment
 - The backend API is deployed on [Cyclic.sh](https://www.cyclic.sh/)
 - The frontend is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
